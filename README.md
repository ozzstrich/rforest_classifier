<h3> Random Forest Classifier </h3>

A random forest classifier I completed as a company task. The company name was removed, and certain aspects have been changed so the company and dataset remains anonymous.
The goal was to classify data into classes 0 or 1, and to maximise the AUC. 
I tried multiple methods including XGBoost and standard linear regression. 
There were also many variants where SMOTE and the Yeo-Johnson power transform were and were not used. 

The best AUC achieved was ~0.78
